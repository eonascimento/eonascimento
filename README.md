### Hey guys, moisturize your elbows!
My name is Ênio Nascimento, I am a curious person and fascinated by technology, which makes computing my best leisure and life purpose.
I believe that professional success is aligned with your level of personal development, so I value good habits, new experiences and good challenges.
Professionally I bring experiences with software projects, actively participating in commercial and scientific proposals.
I have collaborated with projects of several clients such as MAPFRE(BB), EMBRAPA Gado de Leite, STEFANINI, MRS Logística, FGV, ENEVA, SENAC among others.
I currently work as a fullstackt developer with .NET Core, Angular and agile methodology.

Welcome to my silicon garage! Here I have fun challenging my creativity and I end up learning how not to do some things!
Joking aside, but being real, here is a channel I use to gain my problem-solving scars.
If you identified yourself with a "gadget" please contact me it will be a great pleasure to receive your ideas.

In my free time I practice jiu jitsu (👘),
to watch movies (🎞️) and series (📺),
to read books (📚),
to listen to music (🎵) and I use photography as my therapy!(📸).

Would you like some coffee?
