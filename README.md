### Hey guys,

My name is Ênio Nascimento, I currently generate bugs (Emoji:bugs) with continuous integration and continuous delivery on the .Net platform.

Welcome to my silicon garage! Here I have fun challenging my creativity and I end up learning how not to do some things!
Joking aside, but being real, here is a channel I use to gain my problem-solving scars.
If you identified yourself with a "gadget" please contact me it will be a great pleasure to receive your ideas.

In my free time I practice jiu jitsu (Emoji:jitsu),
to watch movies (🎞️) and series (📺),
to read books (📚),
to listen to music (🎵) and I use photography as my therapy!(Emoji:camera).

Would you like some coffee?
